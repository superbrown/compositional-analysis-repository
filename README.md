# data-repository-app
The Data Repository App has been developed for the National Renewable Energy Laboratory by Mike Brown for the purpose of 
storing data and retrieving it later via searches. It has a browser-based UI that users can use to upload two dimensional 
data (i.e. rows and columns) in the form of Excel spreadsheets or comma-separated-value (CSV) files. The ingested data is 
stored in a MongoDB database. The raw uploaded files are stored on the serverâ€™s file system. The app provides a mechanism 
for searching for data rows using user specified criteria, as well as the ability to download the originally uploaded files.
